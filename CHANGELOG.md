# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All releases are currently **public preview releases**. They are Microsoft-signed
> and production-quality but may have breaking changes before GA.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **ACS artifact validation API** - added one bounded Rust-core validator for canonical manifest schema checks, typed ACS semantics, and OPA Rego parsing, exposed with the same structured result through Rust, Python, Node, and .NET. The `acs-generator` CLI now consumes this shared SDK surface.

### Changed
- **OpenCode URL policy hardening** — HTTP(S) forms such as `https:host` are canonicalized before existing `urlRules` are evaluated, and HTTP(S) URL authorities containing backslashes are denied regardless of `urlDefaultEffect` to avoid parser ambiguity.
- **BREAKING: `acs-generator` is CLI-only in `0.4.0b0`.** Removed top-level library re-exports such as `GenerationEngine` and `FakeLanguageModel`. Reusable manifest and Rego validation now lives under `agent_control_specification.validation`; the Python SDK moves to `0.3.1b1`.
- **BREAKING: Python policy runtime now uses native ACS only.** Removed the
  compatibility bridge, pre-ACS rule and result types, runtime folder
  resolution, local framework policy interpreters, and legacy policy
  generators. Framework adapters require `AgentControl`; sandbox providers use
  `runtime=` plus explicit `SandboxConfig`.

### Fixed
- **Spell check no longer reports the base branch's own history as a
  contributor's changes** — `scripts/ci/changed_lines.py` diffed from the tip of
  the base branch, so on a branch behind `main` every line `main` had since
  rewritten counted as newly added. A branch 34 commits behind reported 160,102
  added lines instead of 142, and the spell-check job scoped to them checked
  repository-wide vocabulary. The base is now resolved to its merge base, and
  the depth-limited base fetch in `spell-check.yml` is gone because it truncated
  the history that resolution needs.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-06-25

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Monorepo-wide v5 alignment.** Bumped all first-party Python, TypeScript, .NET, and Rust packages from `4.1.0` to `5.0.0` (plus the top-level `VERSION` file, the `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` banner, and the Claude Code plugin/marketplace manifests), and widened internal cross-package version caps from `<5.0` to `<6.0`. This aligns the released version line with the documentation, which already describes Agent Control Specification (ACS) as the AGT 5.0 policy layer (ACS landed in #2747). Third-party dependency caps, the independently-versioned `policy-engine/` ACS engine (`0.3.1-beta`), and the separately-tagged Go module are unchanged; lockfiles regenerate at publish time.

### Added
- **Agent sandbox nono provider** — added `NonoSandboxProvider` to `agt-sandbox`, a Linux/macOS kernel-enforced sandbox backend via the `nono-py` bindings (Landlock / Seatbelt) with filtered egress, native runtime gating, and AST pre-scan; install with `pip install "agt-sandbox[nono]"`.
- **Command denylist enforcement in RingEnforcer** — added `check_command()` method to `RingEnforcer` that validates subprocess commands against a global `DENIED_COMMANDS` list with case-insensitive matching and shell metacharacter stripping (`;`, `&`, `|`) to prevent injection bypasses. Includes comprehensive test coverage in `tests/unit/test_command_denylist.py`.

### Fixed
- **agent-os policy evaluator** - folder-scoped backend decisions now include `policy`, `backend`, `evaluation_ms`, `context_snapshot`, and `timestamp` fields in `audit_entry`, matching the flat evaluation path and eliminating the parity gap when an external backend (OPA / Cedar) returns a decision under folder-scoped evaluation (#2861).

## [4.0.0] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Python package consolidation** — consolidated 45 Python packages into 5 distributions: `agent-governance-toolkit-core`, `agent-governance-toolkit-runtime`, `agent-governance-toolkit-sre`, `agent-governance-toolkit-cli`, and `agent-governance-toolkit[full]`; legacy package names remain as stub redirects for migration continuity (#2668, #2671)
- **BREAKING: Monorepo-wide v4 alignment** — bumped Python, TypeScript, .NET, Rust, and Go packages to `4.0.0` and updated release/publishing flows for the new package layout (#2669, #2671)
- **Consolidated PII detection patterns into a single shared constant** in `agent_os.integrations.base` ([#2635](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/issues/2635)). The four per-adapter copies (`langchain_adapter`, `autogen_adapter`, `crewai_adapter`, `bedrock_adapter`) now import the shared `PII_PATTERNS` tuple so future adapters cannot silently drift out of sync. The shared constant is the union of patterns previously used across all four adapters, which means LangChain, AutoGen, and CrewAI now also block credit-card PII (previously a Bedrock-only check). `bedrock_adapter._PII_RE` remains as a back-compat alias to the shared constant.
- **mesh-registry**: `POST /reputation` now also increments session counters via the same dispatch path, so a simple reputation update is equivalent to a session start + complete pair. ([#2659](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/pull/2659))

### Added
- **TEE keystore abstraction** — async key-store primitives with `TEEKeyHandle`, `SoftwareKeyHandle`, `LocalTEEKeyStore`, and `MockSKRKeyStore` for attested and software-backed key management (ADR 0010 PR 3) (#2735)
- **New governed CLI packages** — added first-party governance packages for OpenCode (`@microsoft/agent-governance-opencode`), Antigravity CLI (`@microsoft/agent-governance-antigravity-cli`), and Claude Code (`@microsoft/agent-governance-claude-code`) with package wiring, docs, examples, and release automation (#2658, #2554, #2457)
- **Entra-signed JWT verification for AgentMesh** — mesh-relay now validates Entra JWTs on the WebSocket `connect` frame, and mesh-registry adds `/v1/registry/verify` for upgrading agents to verified tier with verified app/tenant metadata, pubkey fallback, and per-agent session counters (`sessions_started`, `sessions_completed`, `sessions_aborted`, `completion_rate`) (#2659, #2719)
- **Wire-protocol-aware policy evaluation across all SDKs** — added SQL- and Kubernetes-aware policy facets to TypeScript, Rust, Go, and .NET so decisions can key off protocol metadata instead of raw text alone (#2553, #2534, #2535, #2537)
- **Credential injection and offload across all SDKs** — added governed credential materialization/offload flows for agent tool calls in TypeScript, Rust, Go, and .NET (#2481, #2535)
- **Credential redaction expansion** — broadened secret/credential redaction coverage across C#, Python, TypeScript, and Rust surfaces (#2737)
- **Sandbox and shell governance** — added a sandbox subprocess code scanner and OpenShell shell interception to inspect code execution paths before launch (#2705, #2704)
- **LangGraph v1.0 governance adapter** — added LangGraph 1.0 support plus stale-auth fingerprinting to catch reused or expired auth context (#2694)
- **AGT test replay engine** — added policy regression replay tooling for replaying captured decision traces against current evaluators (#2619)
- **Cedarling-AgentMesh integration** — added Cedarling community integration plus injected Cedarling-instance support and runnable examples (#2399, #2460)
- **Agent sandbox ACA provider refresh** — updated the Azure Container Apps provider and quickstart for the `0.1.0b1` SDK line (#2675)
- **New runtime and telemetry features** — added a governed-agent-in-10-min demo, Rust feature-gated OTel policy telemetry, a feature-gated Rust `agt` operator CLI, stronger Rust prompt-guard corpora/thresholds, MCP-scan primitive metadata inspection, expanded audit fields (`arguments_hash`, `approver_did`, `policy_version`, `issued_at`, `completed_at`), and registry atomic reputation updates with broader JWKS error handling (#2614, #2539, #2513, #2440, #2438, #2473, #2532, #2733)

### Security
- **Broadened SSN PII regex across integration adapters** ([#2635](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/issues/2635), [#2636](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/pull/2636)) — the dashed-only `\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b` regex used by the LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, and Bedrock adapters to detect SSNs in memory writes and outbound messages was trivially bypassed by space-, dot-, or no-separator variants such as `123 45 6789`, `123.45.6789`, and `123456789`. The pattern is now `\b\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{2}[\s.-]?\d{4}\b`, matching the YAML policy pack fix from [#2594](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/pull/2594) / [#2469](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit/issues/2469).
- **mesh-relay**: when Entra verification is enabled (`AGENTMESH_ENTRA_AUDIENCE` set), the `connect` frame MUST carry a valid Entra JWT. Empty/missing `token` is rejected immediately — there is no silent fallback to the legacy shared-secret path. Closes an auth-bypass surfaced in PR #2659 review where a peer could skip JWT verification by omitting the `token` field.
- **mesh-identity (entra_verifier)**: hard upper bound on stale JWKS cache via `AGENTMESH_ENTRA_JWKS_MAX_STALE_SECS` (default 24h). Beyond the budget, refetch failures fail closed rather than serving from an indefinitely-stale cache. Bounds the window in which a key rotated OUT of the live JWKS remains usable.
- **mesh-identity (entra_verifier)**: pre-validate the JWT header `alg` against `ALLOWED_SIGNING_ALGORITHMS` BEFORE the JWKS lookup. Defense-in-depth against algorithm-confusion attacks (e.g. attacker presents `alg: HS256` hoping the JWK public-key bytes get reused as an HMAC secret); also avoids a wasted network round-trip on obviously-bad tokens.
- **Closed authorization bypasses** in the stateless kernel and execute API; resolved a direct-URL policy bypass in resource validation; and added proof-of-possession enforcement on registry registration and registry endpoints (#2644, #2541, #2542, #2533)
- **Hardened trust boundaries** — tightened POP and capability-grant auth, blocked signing-oracle and unknown-DID auto-trust paths, hardened JWKS/revocation trust fetch and URL allowlist matching, and added registration auth guardrails (#2632, #2633, #2546)
- **Sandbox and service hardening** — hardened the in-process sandbox against stdlib escape paths, added bearer auth and route/credit protections to cloud-board, and expanded mute-agent with 11 red-team regression tests (#2631, #2645, #2690)
- **Additional hardening** — strengthened release automation against unsafe inputs, hardened `AsyncTrustPolicyEvaluator` locking, bound mTLS certificates to Ed25519 identity keys, made workflow designer exports fail closed, hardened trust dashboard HTML rendering, and prevented silent fallback to the mock policy evaluator (#2654, #2448, #2476, #2471, #2472, #2484)
- **Dependency security** — raised the minimum `setuptools` version to `78.1.1` for the published CVE fix (#2752)

### Fixed
- **CI stabilization** — fixed PyJWT/click/rich dependency issues, OPA/Cedar and LangGraph skip markers, conftest imports, flaky package-matrix behavior, and related test-matrix breakage across the consolidated Python package layout (#2720, #2721, #2722, #2723)
- **Build and release fixes** — fixed the Mastra DTS build, updated CI workflow paths after the `packages/` layout migration, and stabilized ESRP/PyPI publishing for the consolidated distributions (#2751, #2712)
- **Various dependency bumps** — refreshed 50+ dependencies across Python, TypeScript, .NET, Rust, docs, and tooling during the v4 line (#2395-#2750)

### Documentation
- **Documentation overhaul** — rewrote the README for clarity, refreshed the homepage and docs site narrative, updated architecture diagrams, and tightened package/install guidance for the consolidated v4 experience (#2407, #2561, #2486, #2524, #2526, #2579)
- **Security and governance documentation** — expanded `SECURITY.md` and the threat model, added CHARTER and succession-planning material, updated Code of Conduct to Contributor Covenant v2.1, and added supply-chain impersonation guidance plus an error-handling guide (#2514, #2510, #2511, #2512, #2613, #2550)
- **Standards, tutorials, and localization** — added ADR-0026 (Foundry AI Gateway PDP), ADR-0028 (AGT Studio), ADR-0029 (policy distribution), the NSA MCP compliance mapping, 60+ tutorial improvements, and Traditional Chinese (`zh-TW`) translations (#2536, #2639, #2691, #2562, #2725)

## [2.0.2] - 2026-03-12

### Changed

- **agent-runtime**: Version bump to align with mono-repo versioning

### Security

- Block `importlib` dynamic imports in sandbox (#189)

## [2.0.1] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- **agent-runtime**: Centralize hardcoded ring thresholds and constants (#188)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-08

### 🚀 Highlights

**15 issues closed, 339+ tests added, 12 architectural features shipped** — in 72 hours from first analysis to merged code. This release transforms the toolkit from a well-structured v1.0 into an enterprise-hardened governance layer with real adversarial durability.

### Added — Security & Adversarial Durability

- **Policy conflict resolution engine** — 4 declared strategies (`DENY_OVERRIDES`, `ALLOW_OVERRIDES`, `PRIORITY_FIRST_MATCH`, `MOST_SPECIFIC_WINS`) with 3-tier policy scope model (global → tenant → agent) and auditable resolution trace. Answers the question every security architect will ask: "if two policies conflict, which wins?" (#91)
- **Session policy pinning** — `create_context()` now deep-copies policy so running sessions get immutable snapshots. Mid-flight policy mutations no longer leak into active sessions. (#92)
- **Tool alias registry** — Canonical capability mapping for 7 tool families (30+ aliases) prevents policy bypass via tool renaming. `bing_search` can no longer dodge a `web_search` block. (#94)
- **Human-in-the-loop escalation** — `EscalationPolicy` with `ESCALATE` tier, `InMemoryApprovalQueue`, and `WebhookApprovalBackend`. Adds the suspend-and-route-to-human path required by regulated industries (healthcare, finance, legal). (#81)

### Added — Reliability & Operations

- **Inter-package version compatibility matrix** — `doctor()` function with runtime compatibility checking across all 5 packages. Detects silent version skew before it causes trust handshake failures. (#83)
- **Credential lifecycle management** — Wired `RevocationList` into `CardRegistry.is_verified()` so revoked credentials are actually rejected. Key rotation now has a kill path. (#82)
- **File-backed trust persistence** — `FileTrustStore` with JSON persistence, atomic writes, and thread safety. Trust scores survive agent restarts — misbehaving agents can no longer reset reputation by crashing. (#86)
- **Policy schema versioning** — `apiVersion` field with validation, migration tooling, and deprecation warnings. Schema evolution in v1.2+ won't silently break existing policy files. (#87)

### Added — Supply Chain & Certification (PR #99)

- **Bootstrap integrity verification** — `IntegrityVerifier` hashes 15 governance module source files and 4 critical function bytecodes (SHA-256) against a published `integrity.json` manifest. Detects supply chain tampering before any policy evaluation occurs. (#95)
- **Governance certification CLI** — `agent-governance verify` checks all 10 OWASP ASI 2026 controls, generates signed attestations, and outputs shields.io badges for README embedding. `agent-governance integrity --generate` creates baseline manifests for release signing.

### Added — Governance Enhancements (PR #90)

- **SIGKILL-analog process isolation** — Real `os.kill(SIGKILL)` for Linux, `TerminateProcess` for Windows, with PID tracking and cgroup integration. Not a simulated kill — actual process-level termination. (#77)
- **OpenTelemetry observability** — `GovernanceTracer` with distributed traces, span events for policy checks, custom metrics (policy evaluations, violations, latency histograms), and OTLP exporter integration. (#76)
- **Async concurrency safety** — `asyncio.Lock` guards on shared state, `ConcurrencyStats` tracking, deadlock detection with configurable timeouts. Concurrent agent evaluations no longer corrupt trust scores. (#75)
- **Policy-as-code CI pipeline** — `PolicyCI` class with YAML linting, schema validation, conflict detection, and dry-run simulation. Integrates with GitHub Actions for PR-time policy validation. (#74)
- **Deep framework integrations** — `LangChainGovernanceCallback`, `CrewAIGovernanceMiddleware`, `AutoGenGovernanceHook` with framework-specific lifecycle hooks, not just wrapper-level interception. (#73)
- **External audit trail integrity** — `SignedAuditEntry` with Ed25519 signatures, `HashChainVerifier` for tamper detection, `FileAuditSink` for append-only external storage. Cryptographic proof that audit logs haven't been modified. (#72)
- **Behavioral anomaly detection** — Statistical anomaly detection for agent behavior patterns (tool call frequency, response time, error rate) with configurable sensitivity. Catches rogue agents before they violate explicit rules. (#71)

### Added — Infrastructure

- **Copilot auto-review workflow** — Automated PR review on every pull request. (#70)
- **7 production module ports** — Episodic Memory Kernel, CMVK, Self-Correcting Agent Kernel, Context-as-a-Service, Agent Control Plane, Trust Engine, Mute Agent infrastructure — ported from internal production with full test coverage. (#63–#69)

### Fixed

- **44 code scanning alerts resolved** — CodeQL SAST findings across the entire repository including CWE-209 (error information exposure), CWE-116 (improper encoding), and CWE-20 (improper input validation). (#79)

### Security

- All cryptographic operations use real Ed25519 primitives (not placeholder/XOR).
- Prompt injection defense verified: `prompt_injection.py` + LlamaFirewall + `OutputValidationMiddleware`.
- SLO alerting verified: `AlertManager` with Slack, PagerDuty, Teams, and OpsGenie channels.

### Test Coverage

- **339+ new tests** across all features with full assertion coverage.
- All 5 packages pass CI independently.
